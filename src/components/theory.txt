*useEffect=to do womething after only the mounting phase ends
 question why useEffect use practricle ans?
 - if we want to execute perticuler function only when the perticular state is change then we can use useEffect for that we just need to put state in dependancy array wich present 
  in use effect so thats why we use useEffect 

*Lifecycles phase-mounting,updating,unmounting
- first time component renders its a mounting phase(Initial rendering/mounting of the component in DOM)
- when we make some changes then rendering happens this is nothing but a updating phase
- The phase when a component deleted from the component tree only once

*Component can be controlled are known as controller component eg input component<input/>>

*why we need to do unmounting?
- to avoid momory leak or we can say to remove useeffect effect
